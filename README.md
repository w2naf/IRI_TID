Perturb PyIRI with TIDs

This code can run PyIRI to create a 3D array of ionospheric electron densities. These can then be perturbed with sinusoidal model traveling ionospheric disturbances. 2D slice profiles can then be generated from the perturbed 3D array. These 2D arrays can then be fed into HF raytracing programs like PyLap/PHaRLAP for HF propagation modeling.
